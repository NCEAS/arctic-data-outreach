## Tokens

Make sure your access tokens are secret and do not commit this information to github where it is public. Add this to the .Renviro file by editing the file using `usethis::edit_r_environ()` in the same directory as the script. Include the following variables and copy the information from twitter:

```
app = "arcticdataerin"
consumer_key =  "ABCDEFG"
consumer_secret =  "ABCDEFG"
access_token =  "ABCDEFG"
access_secret =  "ABCDEFG"
```
