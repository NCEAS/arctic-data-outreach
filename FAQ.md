This draft FAQ is geared at user support. It should be made publicly available on the arcticdata.io site. It is made from actual support tickets, using real questions and real answers.

# ACADIS legacy accounts and formats
Q: I have data under an ACADIS account that I need linked to my new ORCID account
A: We can definitely help link your ACADIS and ORCID accounts. If you have previously submitted data we can get those linked to your ORCID profile.

Q: I was previously submitting data to ACADIS. Now that all the data has been moved I would like to again have access to all those datasets.
A: We are aware that the migration of data sets from ACADIS to the Arctic Data Center led to some issues concerning the creator and keyword fields. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We are currently working through these data sets to update them.

Q: We previously had to use a "CADIS" file format. Do we need to continue with this format, or can we switch to a simpler tab-delimited text file?
A: Yes, please use tab-delimited text files. We encourage the use of text-based, non-proprietary file formats for data storage. Our support team will need to enter the metadata about the columns, we can do that for you.

# DOIs
Q: Why is it necessary to mint new DOIs when there is an update to the analysis?
A: We are committed to providing citable datasets to facilitate reproducible science. When data or metadata are changed, we assign new identifiers to those versions, while maintaining the original versions referenced in a DOI. In this way, researchers that want to access the exact version of data files cited in a publication will be able to do so, but will also have access to newer versions. When you open the older version, it will have a clear message displayed on the top “A newer version of this dataset exists”, with a link to the newest version.
Our approach has been informed by best practices for citing digital research objects, particularly data and software products. Our system is closely aligned with the Force11 Data Citation Principles (https://www.force11.org/group/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-final) , which, in section 7 recommend that:
“Data citations should facilitate identification of, access to, and verification of the specific data that support a claim. Citations or citation metadata should include information about provenance and fixity sufficient to facilitate verifying that the specific time slice, version and/or granular portion of data retrieved subsequently is the same as was originally cited”.
In essence, once a dataset has been published, it cannot be changed, just as a journal article cannot be changed once it is published. The bottom line for us is that for any new version of a dataset, we assign a new identifier so each version (both old and new) can always be cited and accessed without ambiguity as to the content of the dataset.

Q: How long does it take to get a new DOI?
A: Once you make your edits we can mint a new DOI and send it to you within minutes, at least if it occurs during regular business hours (9am to 5pm Pacific Time, weekdays). Updates or submissions during off hours may have to wait until the start of the next business day.

Q: I want to update a dataset that already has a DOI, what is the best way to do that?
A: Usually we would be able to grant you editing permission for data packages, but at present, we are experiencing an issue when users update data sets that already have DOIs. For now, we would prefer that you describe the changes you would like to see made directly in this email thread and we will make the updates for you.

Q: I had previously submitted data to the Arctic Data Center (or ACADIS) and I want to edit my dat record. Will this affect my DOI?
A: Be aware that when you make changes to a data set it will receive a new DOI afterwards. This way any data citation will refer to a preserved and static data set. However, the data set with the original DOI will remain on the repository and will clearly display a message at the top of its page stating that "A newer version of this dataset exists" with a link to the updated version.
This is our way of preserving the revision chain. Therefore, either DOI you cite will enable the user to find the most updated version, but if you would like to be as precise as possible you may want to consider waiting until you receive the new DOI after submitting changes.

# Citations and Credit
Q: "I’m now just noticing this - I entered (Researcher) as the PI, but does that mean that her name will not show up in the citation? As I see it on the page now, it doesn't show her in the citation. I’d like (Researcher) to be included on that as well, but I didn’t see a way to list her as both PI and creator.
A: "Good catch. (Researcher) needs to be listed as a "Creator", in addition to being listed as the "PI", in order to have her name appear in the citation. If you have trouble making this addition we can assist you.

# Editing data and metadata once it has been submitted
Q: I was just going through one of my datasets and I noticed that a few changes need to be made. I have the ability to edit the dataset as the creator, but I want to make specific changes to some of the nested datasets. I am having trouble figuring out how to make these changes through the options available after I click the "edit" button on the top of the dataset page, and I am wondering if you can help with this. The three changes I am looking to make are: 1. Adding data files to one nested dataset 2. Renaming the nested dataset 3. Add an additional nested dataset.
A: We can make the first two changes for you, please attach the data file you would like added in this thread. Please note that when we update data packages that have a DOI, the DOI will change. However, links to the previous DOI will still resolve to the new one. As for the third change: please submit a new data package using the "Submit Data" button on our web form. We will then nest this package with existing set.

Q: We would like to submit another dataset to be nested under a dataset with a pre-existing DOI. Do we need to fill out new metadata or can ADC support staff modify the abstract to include the new data year?
A: We can make those updates for you. Please send the data file to support@arcticdata.io

Q: How do I link a new data to an existing project?
A: To submit a new dataset, you can just click the 'Submit Data' button on our website and fill out that form. Our team will get in touch and handle linking the dataset to a project.

Q: I would like to upload updated data that is a revised analysis of data that was previously there. What is your procedure for this situation? We would like users to use the newest version, but it is
potentially possible that somebody is using the current version on the archive.
A: Our system supports byte-level versioning. We are able to revise an existing dataset with the results of a new analysis. The old version will remain accessible at the same URL, the revised dataset will have a new URL, and the two will be linked. Any use of the old analysis can continue, but if the landing page is visited for the old dataset it will indicate that a newer version is available (and will include a link to it). To revise an existing dataset simply visit the landing page, click "Edit", and make your changes. If you do not have access to a dataset you wish to update please let us know so we may grant you access.

Q: I have a dataset from which a paper is currently ready to be published (proofs). I would like to edit the metadata for this dataset ASAP as the dataset creator and keywords are not correct.
A: We can grant you full access to your dataset. After signing in, click the edit button at the top of the page to correct the creator and keyword fields. While you are there, we would really appreciate the addition of the NSF award number and a methods description as well.

Q: I want to update a dataset that already has a DOI, what is the best way to do that?
A: Usually we would be able to grant you editing permission for data packages, but at present, we are experiencing an issue when users update data sets that already have DOIs. For now, we would prefer that you describe the changes you would like to see made directly in this email thread and we will make the updates for you.

However, the data set with the original DOI will remain on the repository and will clearly display a message at the top of its page stating that "A newer version of this dataset exists" with a link to the updated version.
This is our way of preserving the revision chain. Therefore, either DOI you cite will enable the user to find the most updated version, but if you would like to be as precise as possible you may want to consider waiting until you receive the new DOI after submitting changes.

Q: I manage continuous monitoring of a multi-decadal project. Over the years, a few other metadata records have been created and the datafiles associated with them should really be moved and reorganized with other datasets. If these datafiles are moved, is there a way to have the DOI from the old metadata record point or forward to the correct one?
A: For "cleaning up", it is likely best if you tell us the specific changes you would like to make so that we may apply them for you. This is especially true since you would like to move data files and retain a pointer from the old metadata record to the new/ correct one.

# ORCID
Q: I have a question regarding the future use of my account. I will be graduating my program eventually and am currently training a new graduate student to replace me. Can I shift this account into an institutional account or just change the name to something like "XYZ Lab"? This would prevent all future graduate students in our lab from having to each make their own account, and then resubmit all the data from every year.
A: We could potentially create a group page for the "XYZ Lab", however each contributor would still need to sign in with his/her own ORCiD ID. This is important so that we can track who has edited what and there is accountability and transparency in case of any discrepancies or differences in opinions about what, or how information, ought to be represented.

# Granting Access to collaborators
Q: How do I add access for project collaborators on my project?
A: Let us know who else needs access and we will authorize them from our end!

# Making Datasets Private and Public
Q: I set my dataset as private but actually I would like to change it to public. Is is possible to do that? I tried to edit myself the dataset but it seems that there is a problem, it is always asking me to login, (even when I am already logged in).
A: You will not be able to make the package public, that can only be done from our end. We do not publish data packages until they are finalized. NSF requires that complete metadata be described directly in the metadata record before it can be finalized.

# File Formats
Q: I want to provide my raw data, however the data is in a non-proprietary file format. What do you suggest I do?
A: We appreciate your efforts to archive the raw data. We always strive to do so when those data are in open formats. If providing these data in a non-proprietary format is impractical, are you able to provide processed data in an open format along with a description of the processing? This description could even be to the effective of "we ran the raw data through software X", although more details are always preferred to fewer. By taking the time to convert these to an open format you will vastly improve access to your research.

Q: We previously had to use a "CADIS" file format. Do we need to continue with this format, or can we switch to a simpler tab-delimited text file?
A: Yes, please use tab-delimited text files. We encourage the use of text-based, non-proprietary file formats for data storage. Our support team will need to enter the metadata about the columns, we can do that for you.

Q: I submitted my Excel spreadsheet, am I done?
A: Thank you for your recent submission to the NSF Arctic Data Center. We noticed that the data file was submitted in .xlsx format. We recommend
conversion of this file into a plain text/csv format in order to facilitate an
accurate transfer of information to future researchers and ensure preservation
of the data in perpetuity.

# Large files
Q: I have large data files, what should I do?
A: If you have new data files that are too large (>25MB) to attach in an email, please let us know and we will provide another method for transferring them to us. Options for large datasets include SFTP, or sharing via Google Drive or Dropbox

# Submitting Code and Scripts
Q: What sort of descriptions can I provide for submitting a script?
A: Since your scripts are a form of cyber infrastructure, it is important that we clearly define the following:
- what the script does
- what the inputs and outputs are
- how the script was verified/tested/trained/calibrated/etc.

# Attribute Units
Q: I cannot find an appropriate unit to describe my attribute.
A: Believe us, this has happened before. It's very hard to have an exhaustive list that isn't plain exhausting to look through. We recommend you either reach out to our Data Support team (support@arcticdata.io) to work on a custom unit, or, if you think it's appropriate, you can set your unit as "Other - dimensionless". This works well for counts, percents, concentrations, for example.

# Abstract
Q: Does the Arctic Data Center have any guidance for writing my abstract?
A: We suggest that the abstract be sufficiently descriptive for a general scientific audience. It should provide an overview of the scientific context/ project/ hypotheses, how this data set fits into the larger project, a synopsis of the experimental or sampling design, and a summary of the data contents. If you prefer and it is appropriate, you could add language from the abstract in you
NSF Award.

# Methods
Q: Does the Arctic Data Center have any guidance for writing about my methods?
A: Please ensure enough detail is included in your methods so that another scientist can replicate the study without consulting you nor any other resources. NSF requires that a comprehensive methods section is included directly in the metadata record. Article citations are insufficient. We may be able to extract the methods from the paper for you, but it would be faster and
more precise if you did so. Please send a methods section by either updating
the submission or sending us the language in this email thread.

# Metadata
Q: I have a read.me for my metadata.
A: We recommend standards-based metadata, and will be asking you and your research team, as a part of the data submission process, to create an ecological metadata language (EML) standard metadata. [Read more about metadata here] (https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/writing-metadata), or read the DataOne MetaData Best Practices

Q: What is the metadata language for the Arctic Data Center
A: The Arctic Data Center uses Ecological Metadata Language (EML) for .....
